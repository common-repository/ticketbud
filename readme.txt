== Problems/FAQ ==

<p>1) Q: The plugin isn't updating when my events change.</p>
<p>A: This is because WordPress stores the results it gets from Ticketbud.  Most application behave this way and 'cache' results.  If you've changed your event, for example have changed its name or made it public so that it is visible to the WP plugin, you can easily clear the cache to see the updated results.  Hit the "Reload My Events" button at Plugins->Ticketbud Configuration.</p>
